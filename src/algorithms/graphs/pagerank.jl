"""
    pagerank(G::AbstractGraph; kwargs...)

Compute PageRank scores for vertices of graph `G`.

# Arguments
- `G`: Graph (directed or undirected)
- `damping`: Damping factor (default 0.85)
- `maxiter`: Maximum number of iterations (default 100)
- `tol`: Convergence tolerance (default 1e-6)
- `weights`: Optional dictionary mapping `(u, v)` edges to weights (default `nothing`).
             If provided, transition probabilities are proportional to edge weights.
             If `nothing`, all edges have equal weight.

# Returns
- Vector of PageRank scores (sums to 1)

# Examples
```julia
using Graphs, JuliOpt

# Unweighted directed graph
g = SimpleDiGraph(3)
add_edge!(g, 1, 2)
add_edge!(g, 2, 3)
add_edge!(g, 3, 1)
r = pagerank(g)

# Weighted graph
weights = Dict((1, 2) => 2.0, (2, 3) => 1.0, (3, 1) => 1.0)
r = pagerank(g, weights=weights)
```

# Algorithm
PageRank computes the stationary distribution of a random walk with damping factor α.
With probability α, the walk follows an outgoing edge (weighted proportionally to edge weights).
With probability 1-α, it jumps to a random vertex uniformly.

For weighted graphs, transition probability from u to v is:
    w(u, v) / sum_{k ∈ outneighbors(u)} w(u, k)

Dangling nodes (no outgoing edges) are handled by redistributing their probability uniformly.
