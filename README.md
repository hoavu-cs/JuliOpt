# JuliOpt

A Julia package for combinatorial optimization and graph algorithms. Implements exact, approximate, and heuristic solutions for classic problems in optimization and network analysis. We aim to implement algorithms that are theoretically sound, practical, and those that require more understanding or optimization. 

Claude is often used to generate test cases and some documentation, but the core algorithms and implementations are mostly written and optimized by the author. 

There are some NP-Hard problems with no known polynomial-time approximation. For these, we try to come up with heuristics that help reduce the search space (such as in densest at-most-k-subgraph). Some are dealt with using parameterization. 

## Installation

## Usage

All algorithms return a tuple of `(objective_value, selected_items)`.

### Knapsack

```julia
using JuliOpt

W = 10
weights = [2, 3, 4, 5]
values  = [3, 4, 5, 6]

# Exact solution
value, items = exact_knapsack(W, weights, values)

# PTAS with epsilon = 0.1
value, items = ptas_knapsack(W, 0.1, weights, values)
```

### Bin Packing

```julia
items = [7, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6]
capacity = 10

num_bins, bins = bin_packing(items, capacity)
```

### Weighted Interval Scheduling

```julia
starts  = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8]
ends    = [4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
weights = [3, 2, 4, 7, 2]

value, selected = weighted_interval_scheduling(starts, ends, weights)
```

### Set Cover

```julia
subsets = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4, 5]]
costs   = [1.0, 2.0, 1.5]

cost, selected = set_cover(subsets, costs)
```

### Maximum Coverage

```julia
subsets = [[1, 2], [2, 3, 4], [4, 5]]
k = 2

covered, selected = max_coverage(subsets, Int64(k))
```

### Influence Maximization

```julia
using Graphs, JuliOpt

g = SimpleDiGraph(5)
add_edge!(g, 1, 2); add_edge!(g, 2, 3)
add_edge!(g, 3, 4); add_edge!(g, 4, 5)

weights = Dict((src(e), dst(e)) => 0.5 for e in edges(g))
k = 2

seeds, spread = influence_maximization_ic(g, weights, k)
```

### Densest Subgraph

```julia
using Graphs, JuliOpt

g = complete_graph(5)
add_vertex!(g)
add_edge!(g, 1, 6)  # pendant vertex

S, density = densest_subgraph(g)
# S = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], density = 2.0

# Densest subgraph with at most k vertices
S, d = JuliOpt.densest_at_most_k_subgraph(g, 3)
# Finds the 3-vertex subset with highest density
```

## Testing

# Run all tests
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'

# Run a single test file
julia --project -e 'using JuliOpt; using Test; include("test/knapsack_test.jl")'

# With threads (needed for influence maximization)
julia --threads=auto --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
```
